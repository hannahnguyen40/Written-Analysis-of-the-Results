# Written Analysis of the Results#
## Overview of Project ##
The purpose of this analysis is to help students to review and in continuance of research about Excel's features and functions. Even the challenge does not include all 
functions learned, but Features and functions learned throughout this Excell module include: learning the face stuctures of Excel, different formattings, Filter function, 
Freezing function, Conditional formatting function, ROUND function, IFERROR function, identifying outliers, and visual with box plots.
## Analysis and Challenges ##
Challenges I encountered include figuring formulas for a certain function. For example finding formulas for standard deviation and mean, creating pivot tables with locating 
correct inputs to create correct columns and rows, how to set COUNTIFS function for each different data, and opening up to write a readme file on GitHub.
All are new to me, and I got over these challenges by keeping on going over and finding solutions until I got it.
